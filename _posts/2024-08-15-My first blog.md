This is my first blog on my first personal website.
Here to record how to push files to github repository after file modification.
OS: Win 11

1. Github bash at the local repository folder.
1. Enter git add . to make all the files in the folder ready to upload.
1. Enter git commit -m "whatever you would like to type"
1. Enter git push to upload all the files to the online github repository.
